## The big picture
#### Pay attention to the relationship between classes. 
- IS-A
- HAS-A
- IMPLEMENTS

#### HAS-A can be better than IS-A:
- When you put two classes together like this, you're using composition. Instead of inheriting their behavior, the ducks get their behavior by being composed with the right behavior object.
